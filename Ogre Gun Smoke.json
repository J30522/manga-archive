  "description": "There's a legendary killer stalking the street whose name comes from a monster of our nightmares, one that emerges from the shadows to feast on the evil-doers. And tonight, he has his sights on a gangster who has a trick up his sleeves tooâ€¦\n\nOneshot that was originally published on Young Animal magazine (2018). That print version is slightly different from the raw posted on the author's twitter.",
