  "description": "Doubara lives a simple quiet life, working during the day and immersing himself in reading light novels during his off-times. He never had any connections with other people, most of all girls except for a brief and unfortunate incident in high school. So he finds himself shocked when the girl of that experience, Mio, suddenly appears on his door step with a rather surprising news, that she believes her son had reincarnated into another world and she intends to find a way to follow him there.",
