  "description": "Tokuyama Takehiro is a young game programmer who has taken on his first big project as the lead programmer. Not only that, he is also pulling a double duty as the project's director. He finds the stress of his first big project overwhelming and he ends up using food as solace at a local okonomiyaki shop. There he meets a precocious young girl who seems to take an instant liking to him and seems to know far more about him than anyone should, except perhapsâ€¦ his dead mom?\n\nNote: Readers familiar with (the infamous) Ditama Bow should be aware that this is nothing like the Kiss x Sis and while it touches on some mature topics, it is not an ecchi work.",
