  "description": "Yasuha has thrown off everything she worked for in the city, quit her black company, left her underappreciative superiors, and moves back to the countryside to live with her recently windowed grandmother. Just a summer vacation to recharge, she tells herself. Then she meets two curious kids while camping in the mountain, and they are not what they seem. Together, they forge an unlikely friendship and Yasuha relearns what makes life worth living.",
